# fluentstream_beer_app

A simple React web application that displays beers in the cooler, allows adding new beers, and changing the number of likes for each beer.

## Installation

In the root directory, run `yarn install` to install the dependencies for the application. Then afterwards, run `yarn start` to start the app on your local development server.

## Running the Application

Due to CORS blocking on the side of the Beer API that is pinged inside of the application, it is necesssary to install an extension that bypasses the need for the Allow-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response for the application to work properly. If using chrome, I recommend `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en`.
